# TECHFOOR

#Introduction: “TECHFOOR” is generally a search engine designed by Gazi Maruf Rahman. 

#1. How did i become interested in building a search engine?

As Computer Science students, I always wanted to do something big. And that’s my first step to fulfilling my dream. This is a mega project. When I  were children, I used to read that our country has a search engine named “PIPILIKA”. It was our honor that Bangladesh has a search engine. So that was my first impression of creating a search engine like PIPILIKA and became an inspiration to the young generation. Also, Duckduckgo inspired me a lot.

#2. How to use the TECHFOOR?
	
The project to build a search engine is still on processing. That’s why I couldn’t call the TECHFOOR, a public search engine. At this stage of the search engine, I just have the option of admin login. Without the admins, nobody is permitted to use this right now. I have some limited data in this search engine and that’s why if I want to use it like Google or other public search engines, then it won’t give me the proper service. As I added first, it will take more time to become a proper public search engine.
